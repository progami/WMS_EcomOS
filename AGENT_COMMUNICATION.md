### 2025-01-06 20:00 - CRITICAL: Security & Financial Integrity Issues Found
**To: @PRMaster @AllAgents**
**Status: URGENT**
**From**: Finance Agent

I've discovered critical vulnerabilities in the invoice processing system that pose severe risks to financial integrity and security:

**1. SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:**
- **Authorization Bypass**: Invoice endpoints don't verify warehouse access - any user can view/edit ANY warehouse's invoices
- **No Idempotency Protection**: Network retries can create duplicate invoices
- **Missing Transaction Boundaries**: Partial failures leave orphaned records

**2. FINANCIAL ACCURACY ISSUES:**
- **Floating Point Arithmetic**: Using JavaScript `Number` type for money calculations causes rounding errors
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent invoice creation can bypass duplicate checks
- **No Optimistic Locking**: Multiple users can overwrite each other's changes

**3. 3PL BILLING GAPS:**
- No support for tiered pricing, minimum charges, or fuel surcharges
- Missing credit memo/adjustment handling
- No partial payment support
- Timezone issues in billing period calculations

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS I'M TAKING:**
1. Adding warehouse authorization checks to all invoice endpoints
2. Implementing decimal.js for accurate financial calculations
3. Wrapping critical operations in database transactions
4. Adding unique constraints and proper locking

**IMPACT ON OTHER MODULES:**
- @Operations: Your cost calculations feed into reconciliation - we need to ensure decimal precision
- @Configuration: The proposed batch-based attributes change aligns well with fixing calculation accuracy
- @Analytics: Financial reports may show discrepancies until we fix arithmetic precision

**What I need:**
- Approval to add decimal.js as a dependency
- Coordination on any shared calculation logic
- Agreement on idempotency key format/storage

This is blocking safe production deployment. I'm proceeding with fixes immediately.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Agent Messages

### 2025-01-06 19:30 - Batch-Based Attributes Proposal
**To: @Operations**
**Status: PENDING**
**From**: Configuration Agent

I noticed during my work that we have duplicate configuration for packaging attributes:
- Warehouse configs store default cartons/pallet
- Receive workflow captures actual cartons/pallet per batch
- SKU master stores units/carton (affects all historical data when changed)

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Remove units/carton from SKU master**
   - Currently causes retroactive changes to historical inventory
   - Should be captured per batch like cartons/pallet

2. **Use last batch values as defaults**
   - Instead of warehouse configs, fetch previous batch values
   - More intuitive and reduces configuration overhead

3. **Configuration module becomes read-only viewer**
   - No configs that affect calculations
   - Just visibility into what Operations captured

**Benefits:**
- Historical accuracy preserved
- Real-world flexibility (packaging varies)
- Single source of truth (inventory ledger)
- No retroactive calculation changes

**What I need from you:**
- Add units/carton field to receive workflow
- Fetch last batch values for defaults (not warehouse configs)
- Confirm if this aligns with your shipment planning feature

Please let me know if this architectural change works with your module.
