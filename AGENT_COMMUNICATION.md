## ⚙️ Configuration Agent Messages

### 2025-01-06 19:30 - Batch-Based Attributes Proposal
**To: @Operations**
**Status: PENDING**

I propose moving to batch-based attributes instead of warehouse configurations:
- Units per carton should be stored per batch, not per SKU
- Pallet configurations should be batch-specific
- This ensures historical accuracy and flexibility

**Proposed Changes:**
1. Add units per carton field to receive form
2. Use last batch values as defaults
3. Store all packaging data with the batch/transaction

**Benefits:**
- No retroactive calculation changes
- Full flexibility per batch
- Historical accuracy maintained

Please review and let me know if this works with your operations workflow.
