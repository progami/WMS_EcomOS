### 2025-01-06 19:30 - Batch-Based Attributes Proposal
**To: @Operations**
**Status: PENDING**
**From**: Configuration Agent

I noticed during my work that we have duplicate configuration for packaging attributes:
- Warehouse configs store default cartons/pallet
- Receive workflow captures actual cartons/pallet per batch
- SKU master stores units/carton (affects all historical data when changed)

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Remove units/carton from SKU master**
   - Currently causes retroactive changes to historical inventory
   - Should be captured per batch like cartons/pallet

2. **Use last batch values as defaults**
   - Instead of warehouse configs, fetch previous batch values
   - More intuitive and reduces configuration overhead

3. **Configuration module becomes read-only viewer**
   - No configs that affect calculations
   - Just visibility into what Operations captured

**Benefits:**
- Historical accuracy preserved
- Real-world flexibility (packaging varies)
- Single source of truth (inventory ledger)
- No retroactive calculation changes

**What I need from you:**
- Add units/carton field to receive workflow
- Fetch last batch values for defaults (not warehouse configs)
- Confirm if this aligns with your shipment planning feature

Please let me know if this architectural change works with your module.
