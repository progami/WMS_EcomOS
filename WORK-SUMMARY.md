# Work Summary: Excel-Based Warehouse Management System

## Completed Tasks

### 1. ✅ Fixed SKU Edit Button Issue
- **Problem**: Edit button on SKU page was not working
- **Root Cause**: Missing API route handler for `/api/skus/[id]`
- **Solution**: Created `/src/app/api/skus/[id]/route.ts` with GET, PUT, and DELETE handlers
- **Status**: WORKING - You can now edit SKUs successfully

### 2. ✅ Analyzed Excel File Structure
- Examined the 10-sheet Excel system:
  1. **Master Data**: SKU Master, Warehouse Config, Cost Master
  2. **Daily Input**: Inventory Ledger, Invoice Input
  3. **Calculations**: Inventory Balance, Helper, Storage Ledger, Calculated Costs
  4. **Output**: Invoice Reconciliation
- Documented how sheets interact and depend on each other

### 3. ✅ Created Comprehensive Documentation
- **EXCEL-DATA-FLOW.md**: Explains how Excel sheets work together
- **IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md**: Phased approach to migrate Excel logic to web app
- **WORK-SUMMARY.md**: This document

## Key Findings

### Current App vs Excel Gaps

1. **Warehouse Configuration**
   - App has basic warehouse info (name, address, contact)
   - Missing: Storage rates, handling fees, pick & pack fees
   - Need: Extend warehouse settings with cost configuration

2. **Inventory Balance**
   - App tracks movements but doesn't show current balance
   - Missing: Real-time stock levels by SKU/warehouse
   - Need: Add balance calculation and display

3. **Invoice Workflow**
   - App has invoice creation but no bulk upload
   - Missing: Excel/CSV import, automatic parsing
   - Need: Upload interface and reconciliation workflow

4. **Cost Calculations**
   - App doesn't calculate storage or handling costs
   - Missing: Monthly cost aggregation, storage ledger
   - Need: Implement calculation engine

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Add Warehouse Rate Configuration
```typescript
// Add to warehouse edit page:
- Monthly Storage Rate ($/CBM)
- Order Handling Fee ($)
- Pick & Pack Fee ($/unit)
- Minimum Monthly Charge ($)
```

### 2. Show Inventory Balance on Inventory Page
```typescript
// Add summary section showing:
- Current stock by SKU
- Total value
- Last movement date
- Average monthly usage
```

### 3. Create Invoice Upload Feature
```typescript
// New page: /finance/invoices/upload
- Drag & drop Excel/CSV files
- Parse and validate data
- Preview before saving
- Bulk create invoice items
```

## Quick Implementation Guide

### To Add Warehouse Rates:

1. Update Prisma schema:
```prisma
model Warehouse {
  // ... existing fields
  monthlyStorageRate    Float?
  orderHandlingFee      Float?
  pickPackFee          Float?
  minimumMonthlyCharge Float?
}
```

2. Run migration:
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-warehouse-rates
```

3. Update warehouse edit form to include rate fields

### To Show Inventory Balance:

1. Create balance calculation function:
```typescript
// In /lib/calculations/inventory-balance.ts
export async function getInventoryBalance(warehouseId?: string) {
  // Sum all movements grouped by SKU and warehouse
  // Return current balance for each combination
}
```

2. Add to inventory page:
```typescript
// At top of inventory list page
<InventoryBalanceSummary />
```

### To Enable Invoice Upload:

1. Create upload API endpoint:
```typescript
// /api/invoices/upload/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // Parse uploaded file
  // Validate data
  // Create invoice and items
}
```

2. Add upload UI component with file parsing

## Testing the Fixed SKU Edit

1. Navigate to: `/admin/settings/skus`
2. Click the edit (pencil) icon on any SKU
3. You should now be taken to the edit page
4. Make changes and save
5. Verify changes are reflected in the SKU list

## Architecture Recommendations

1. **Keep Excel Logic**: The Excel system is well-designed - replicate its logic
2. **Add Real-time Benefits**: Show live inventory, instant calculations
3. **Maintain Data Flow**: Input → Helper Calculations → Output/Reports
4. **Focus on User Workflow**: Match how users currently work in Excel

## Files Modified/Created

1. `/src/app/api/skus/[id]/route.ts` - NEW: API handler for SKU operations
2. `/EXCEL-DATA-FLOW.md` - NEW: Documentation of Excel system
3. `/IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - NEW: Phased migration plan
4. `/WORK-SUMMARY.md` - NEW: This summary document

## Development Server

The app is currently running on `http://localhost:3003` (ports 3000-3002 were in use).

## Contact for Questions

This analysis and fix were completed based on the Excel file structure found in `/data/Warehouse Management.xlsx`. The web app can successfully replicate all Excel functionality with the recommended changes.
