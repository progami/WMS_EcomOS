# SSM Deployment Summary for WMS Application

## Current Status

I've created a comprehensive SSM-based deployment solution for the WMS application since SSH is completely blocked at the AWS account level.

### What Was Done

1. **Created Multiple Deployment Scripts**:
   - `scripts/ssm-deploy-final.sh` - Comprehensive deployment script
   - `scripts/ssm-deploy-inline.sh` - Inline deployment with all commands
   - `scripts/ssm-deploy-simple.sh` - Step-by-step deployment
   - `scripts/ssm-complete-fix.sh` - Complete fix script
   - `scripts/ssm-quick-test.sh` - Quick test script
   - `scripts/ssm-diagnose.sh` - Diagnostic script

2. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - Created `.github/workflows/deploy-ssm.yml` for automated SSM-based deployments
   - Supports manual triggers with different actions (deploy, restart, status)

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive `docs/SSM_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
   - Includes troubleshooting steps and command examples

### Current Issues

The deployment scripts are executing but the application is not accessible from outside. This could be due to:

1. **Network Configuration**: The security groups are properly configured (ports 80, 443, 3000 are open), but there might be network ACLs or other AWS-level restrictions
2. **Application Issues**: The application might be failing to start properly
3. **SSM Command Execution**: Some commands are failing during execution

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Install Session Manager Plugin**:
   ```bash
   # On macOS:
   curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/mac/sessionmanager-bundle.zip" -o "sessionmanager-bundle.zip"
   unzip sessionmanager-bundle.zip
   sudo ./sessionmanager-bundle/install -i /usr/local/sessionmanager -b /usr/local/bin/session-manager-plugin
   ```

   Then you can connect interactively:
   ```bash
   aws ssm start-session --target i-0fb1f56a90fe95bac --region us-east-1
   ```

2. **Check CloudWatch Logs**:
   The SSM commands might be outputting to CloudWatch. Check the AWS Console for any SSM-related logs.

3. **Use AWS Console**:
   - Go to Systems Manager > Session Manager in AWS Console
   - Start a session with the instance
   - Manually run the deployment commands to see what's failing

4. **Alternative Deployment Methods**:
   - Use AWS CodeDeploy for more robust deployments
   - Consider using ECS or Elastic Beanstalk for easier management
   - Use S3 to transfer files and SSM to execute deployment scripts

### Quick Commands Reference

Check if SSM agent is online:
```bash
aws ssm describe-instance-information --instance-information-filter-list key=InstanceIds,valueSet=i-0fb1f56a90fe95bac --region us-east-1
```

Check application status:
```bash
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0fb1f56a90fe95bac --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" --parameters 'commands=["pm2 status","curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health"]' --region us-east-1
```

View PM2 logs:
```bash
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0fb1f56a90fe95bac --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" --parameters 'commands=["pm2 logs wms --lines 100"]' --region us-east-1
```

Restart application:
```bash
aws ssm send-command --instance-ids i-0fb1f56a90fe95bac --document-name "AWS-RunShellScript" --parameters 'commands=["pm2 restart wms"]' --region us-east-1
```

### Files Created

1. **Deployment Scripts** (in `/scripts/`):
   - ssm-deploy-final.sh
   - ssm-deploy-inline.sh
   - ssm-deploy-simple.sh
   - ssm-complete-fix.sh
   - ssm-quick-test.sh
   - ssm-diagnose.sh
   - ssm-check-status.sh
   - ssm-fix-deployment.sh
   - create-ssm-document.sh

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - .github/workflows/deploy-ssm.yml

3. **Documentation**:
   - docs/SSM_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md
   - SSM_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md (this file)

### Next Actions

1. Install the Session Manager plugin and connect directly to debug
2. Check AWS CloudWatch logs for SSM command outputs
3. Verify that the instance has proper IAM roles for all required services
4. Consider using AWS CodeDeploy or another deployment service
5. Test the deployment scripts from within the AWS Console's Session Manager

The infrastructure and scripts are in place for SSM-based deployment. The main issue now is debugging why the application isn't starting properly, which requires interactive access via Session Manager or checking CloudWatch logs.
