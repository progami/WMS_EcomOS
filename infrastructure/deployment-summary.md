# Deployment Summary Report

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. Cleaned Up Old Deployment Approaches
- Removed 14 legacy deployment scripts
- Consolidated to GitHub Actions-only approach
- Updated documentation to reflect new workflow

### 2. Updated Infrastructure Code
- Enhanced EC2 user_data script with:
  - PostgreSQL setup with wms user/database
  - Nginx configuration for Next.js
  - PM2 installation and startup configuration
  - Directory structure preparation
- Configured for GitHub Actions compatibility

### 3. Updated Makefile
- Removed old deployment commands (deploy, check-status, retry-deploy)
- Added new commands:
  - `make provision` - Create AWS infrastructure
  - `make status` - Check infrastructure and app status
- Simplified workflow for GitHub Actions approach

### 4. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow
- Optimized build process (builds on GitHub, not EC2)
- Added Prisma generation step
- Improved deployment package (only necessary files)
- Added health check after deployment
- Better error handling and rollback capability

### 5. Testing Completed
- **Curl Test**: ✅ Nginx responding with HTTP 200
- **Playwright Test**: ✅ Confirmed nginx default page visible
- **Screenshot**: Saved visual confirmation

## 📊 Current State

| WMS App | ❌ Not Deployed | Awaiting GitHub Actions |

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

```
Developer Machine
    ↓ git push
GitHub Repository
    ↓ webhook trigger
GitHub Actions Runner
    ├─ npm install
    ├─ npm run build
    ├─ Create package
    └─ SSH deploy
         ↓
    EC2 Instance
    ├─ Extract files
    ├─ Install deps
    ├─ Run migrations
    └─ PM2 restart
```

## 📝 What Was Changed

### Removed Files
- All manual deployment scripts in `/infrastructure/deploy/`
- Complex deployment approaches (S3, SSM, etc.)

### Added/Updated Files
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Optimized for production
- `infrastructure/terraform/environments/prod/main.tf` - Enhanced user_data
- `infrastructure/Makefile` - Simplified commands
- `infrastructure/setup-github-secrets.sh` - Setup helper
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide

## 🔑 Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Add GitHub Secrets**:
   ```
   EC2_HOST: 54.174.226.39
   EC2_SSH_KEY: [contents of ~/.ssh/wms-prod]
   ```

2. **Deploy Application**:
   - Push to main branch, OR
   - Manually trigger in GitHub Actions tab

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   make status
   curl http://54.174.226.39
   ```

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

- SSH key is kept as GitHub secret (not in code)
- Database password in environment variables
- Nginx configured as reverse proxy
- Security group limits SSH access

## 📈 Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simple**: One-command deployment via git push
2. **Reliable**: Build happens on GitHub's infrastructure
3. **Fast**: t2.micro only runs the app, not builds
4. **Auditable**: All deployments tracked in GitHub
5. **Rollback**: Easy revert via GitHub

This setup follows industry best practices for small to medium applications, providing a solid foundation that can scale as needed.
