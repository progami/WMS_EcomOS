# WMS Vulnerability Test Suite Summary

This comprehensive test suite demonstrates critical vulnerabilities and edge cases in the WMS application. All tests are designed to **FAIL** on the current implementation, highlighting security risks and bugs that need immediate attention.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Found

### 1. **Race Conditions** (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Concurrent Inventory Updates**: Multiple shipments can deplete the same batch beyond available quantity, creating negative inventory
- **Invoice Number Generation**: Parallel invoice creation can generate duplicate invoice numbers
- **Payment Processing**: Concurrent payments can exceed invoice amounts
- **FIFO Violations**: Race conditions in batch selection can violate FIFO ordering

### 2. **Authentication & Authorization** (CRITICAL)
- **No Rate Limiting**: Brute force attacks are possible with unlimited login attempts
- **Session Management**: Sessions remain valid after role changes, enabling privilege retention
- **CSRF Protection Missing**: State-changing operations lack CSRF token validation
- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Users can access resources they shouldn't have permissions for

### 3. **Financial Calculations** (HIGH SEVERITY)
- **Division by Zero**: Storage calculations with zero pallet configurations crash
- **Floating Point Errors**: Money calculations lose precision, causing accounting discrepancies
- **Timezone Issues**: Billing calculations fail across DST boundaries
- **No Audit Trail**: Financial calculations lack traceable history

### 4. **Data Validation & Security** (CRITICAL)
- **XSS Vulnerabilities**: User inputs (batch names, tracking numbers) not sanitized
- **SQL Injection**: Search queries vulnerable to injection attacks
- **Excel Formula Injection**: Malicious formulas in imports can execute commands
- **Path Traversal**: File operations vulnerable to directory traversal attacks

### 5. **Memory & Performance** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
- **Large File Handling**: No memory limits for file uploads, causing OOM errors
- **Unbounded Queries**: Database queries lack pagination, can return millions of records
- **CPU Blocking**: Synchronous calculations block the event loop
- **Memory Leaks**: File processing doesn't clean up resources

### 6. **API Integration** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
- **No Rate Limit Handling**: Amazon API rate limits cause failures without retry
- **Missing Timeouts**: External API calls can hang indefinitely
- **No Circuit Breaker**: Failed services are called repeatedly
- **Partial Failure Handling**: Batch operations don't handle partial failures

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure test database is set up
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set environment variables for test database

### Run All Vulnerability Tests
```bash
cd tests/vulnerability-tests
npm test
```

### Run Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Race conditions
npm test race-conditions/

# Authentication
npm test auth-security/

# Financial calculations
npm test financial-calculations/

# Data validation
npm test data-validation/

# Performance
npm test memory-performance/

# API integration
npm test api-integration/
```

### Run Playwright E2E Tests
```bash
# Ensure the app is running on localhost:3000
cd tests/vulnerability-tests
npx playwright test e2e-edge-cases/
```

## Expected Results

**ALL TESTS SHOULD FAIL** - This indicates the vulnerabilities exist in the current implementation.

If any test passes, it means that particular vulnerability has been fixed.

## Remediation Priority

1. **CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required**
   - SQL Injection vulnerabilities
   - XSS vulnerabilities
   - Missing authentication checks
   - CSRF protection

2. **HIGH - Fix Within Sprint**
   - Race conditions in inventory
   - Financial calculation precision
   - Session management issues
   - Input validation

3. **MEDIUM - Plan for Next Release**
   - Performance optimizations
   - API integration improvements
   - Memory management
   - Error handling

## Next Steps

1. Review each failing test to understand the vulnerability
2. Implement fixes following security best practices
3. Re-run tests to confirm vulnerabilities are resolved
4. Add these tests to CI/CD pipeline
5. Conduct security audit of remaining codebase

## Security Best Practices to Implement

1. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all user inputs
2. **Database Transactions**: Use proper locking for concurrent operations
3. **Authentication**: Implement rate limiting and session management
4. **Error Handling**: Never expose internal errors to users
5. **API Security**: Use timeouts, retries, and circuit breakers
6. **Memory Management**: Implement streaming for large files
7. **Audit Logging**: Track all financial and security-critical operations
