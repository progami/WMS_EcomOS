# Vulnerability Test Fixes Applied

This document summarizes all the fixes applied to make the vulnerability tests compatible with the actual Prisma schema.

## Schema Compatibility Fixes

### 1. User Model Field Names
- Changed `name` to `fullName` for user models
- Changed `password` to `passwordHash` for user models
- Changed role values: `'USER'` → `'staff'`, `'ADMIN'` → `'admin'`
- Added required `passwordHash` field where missing

### 2. Warehouse Model Field Names
- Fixed incorrect usage of `fullName` back to `name` for warehouse models  
- Changed `status` to `isActive` with proper boolean values
- `status: 'active'` → `isActive: true`
- `status: 'inactive'` → `isActive: false`

### 3. Customer Model References
- Replaced non-existent `customer` model with `user` model
- Changed `companyName` to `fullName`
- Removed `customerCode` field (doesn't exist in schema)

### 4. Test Implementation Fixes

#### auth-vulnerabilities.test.ts
- Fixed mock function calls: `mockGetServerSession()` → `getServerSession()`
- Fixed role type casting issues

#### input-validation.test.ts  
- Fixed SQL injection test to use parameterized queries correctly
- Fixed Excel formula injection test expectations
- Fixed path traversal test logic for encoded patterns
- Fixed object property references (`disguisedFile.name` → `disguisedFile.fullName`)
- Fixed typo: `userfullName` → `username`

#### Other Tests
- Updated all user and warehouse creation patterns across all test files
- Ensured consistent field names throughout

## Files Modified

1. `/tests/vulnerability-tests/auth-security/auth-vulnerabilities.test.ts`
2. `/tests/vulnerability-tests/auth-security/session-vulnerabilities.test.ts`
3. `/tests/vulnerability-tests/data-validation/file-upload-security.test.ts`
4. `/tests/vulnerability-tests/data-validation/input-validation.test.ts`
5. `/tests/vulnerability-tests/financial-calculations/billing-edge-cases.test.ts`
6. `/tests/vulnerability-tests/financial-calculations/financial-vulnerabilities.test.ts`
7. `/tests/vulnerability-tests/race-conditions/inventory-race-conditions.test.ts`
8. `/tests/vulnerability-tests/race-conditions/invoice-race-conditions.test.ts`

## Running the Tests

To run the vulnerability tests after these fixes:

```bash
# From the vulnerability-tests directory
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://test:test@localhost:5432/wms_test" npm test

# Or run specific test suites
npx jest auth-security/
npx jest data-validation/
npx jest financial-calculations/
npx jest race-conditions/
```

## Note on Database Access

The tests require a properly configured test database. If you see database access errors, ensure:
1. The test database exists
2. The DATABASE_URL is correctly set
3. The test user has proper permissions

## Expected Behavior

These are vulnerability demonstration tests - they are EXPECTED TO FAIL to show that vulnerabilities exist in the simulated vulnerable implementations. The tests passing would indicate that the vulnerabilities have been fixed in the actual application code.
