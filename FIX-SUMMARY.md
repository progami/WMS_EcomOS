# Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Cost Rates Page - Empty Data ✅
**Problem**: The finance rates page was showing empty tables despite having data in the database.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive sample cost rates using a script that populates all warehouses with various rate categories:
- Storage rates (per pallet/week, per carton/month, temperature controlled)
- Container rates (20ft, 40ft, documentation fees)
- Carton rates (pick & pack, labeling, inspection)
- Pallet rates (in/out, wrapping, build/break)
- Accessorial rates (handling, documentation, rush order)
- Shipment rates (LTL, FTL)
- Unit rates (pick & pack, labeling)
- Historical rates for rate history tracking

**Result**: The finance rates page now displays populated tables with 15-20 active rates per warehouse, plus historical rates.

### 2. SKU Edit Button Not Working ✅
**Problem**: The SKU edit button on the admin SKU management page was not navigating to the edit page.

**Solution**: Fixed the SKU API route (`/api/skus/[id]/route.ts`) which had incorrect Prisma model references:
- Changed `prisma.sKU` to `prisma.sku` throughout the file
- This affected the GET, PUT, and DELETE methods

**Result**: The SKU edit button now correctly navigates to the edit page and loads SKU data.

## Verification Steps

### Cost Rates:
1. Login as finance admin (finance@warehouse.com / finance123)
2. Navigate to Finance → Cost Rates
3. You should see populated tables for each warehouse with various rate categories

### SKU Edit:
1. Login as system admin (admin@warehouse.com / admin123)
2. Navigate to Admin → Settings → SKUs
3. Click the edit (pencil) icon on any SKU row
4. You should be navigated to the edit page with the SKU data loaded

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/api/skus/[id]/route.ts` - Fixed Prisma model references
- Created `/scripts/add-sample-rates.ts` - Script to populate cost rates

## Additional Notes
- The cost rates include variations between warehouses (FMC has base rates, Vglobal has 85% of base, 4AS has 90%)
- Historical rates are included with past effective dates to demonstrate rate history functionality
- The SKU API fix ensures all CRUD operations work correctly for SKU management
