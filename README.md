# Warehouse Management System

A comprehensive warehouse management system built with Next.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL for managing inventory, billing, and operations across multiple warehouses.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The system is organized into business domain modules:

- **Finance** (`/finance`) - Invoices, reconciliation, financial dashboard
- **Configuration** (`/config`) - Products, locations, rates, warehouse configs
- **Analytics** (`/reports` & `/integrations`) - Reports, Amazon FBA, data exports
- **Admin** (`/admin`) - User management and system settings

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL 14+
- npm or yarn

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd warehouse_management
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/warehouse_management"

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-generate-with-openssl"

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Amazon Integration (optional)
AMAZON_SP_APP_ID="your-app-id"
AMAZON_REFRESH_TOKEN="your-refresh-token"
AMAZON_MARKETPLACE_ID="A1F83G8C2ARO7P"  # UK
AMAZON_REGION="eu-west-1"
```

Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 4. Set up the database
```bash
# Run Prisma migrations
npx prisma db push

# Seed the database with initial data
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts

# Note: Immutable ledger constraints are applied automatically via database migrations
```

**Note**: The inventory ledger is designed to be immutable for audit compliance. Once applied, transactions cannot be edited or deleted - only adjustment entries can be made.

### 5. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## 📚 Important Notes

### Immutable Inventory Ledger
The inventory ledger follows accounting best practices:
- **No Edits**: Once created, transactions cannot be modified
- **No Deletes**: All records are permanent for audit trail
- **Corrections**: Use ADJUST_IN/ADJUST_OUT transactions to fix errors
- **Database Triggers**: PostgreSQL triggers enforce immutability
- **Chronological Order**: Transactions must be entered in date order (no backdating)
- **Pickup Date Tracking**: Separate tracking for transaction and pickup dates with reconciliation status

### Data Management
- Initial data has been imported from Excel (174 transactions)
- All ongoing data entry should be through the web interface
- The system maintains data integrity and prevents duplicate entries
- Full export capabilities available for backup and reporting

### Currency
All monetary values are in GBP (£) including:
- Storage rates (per pallet per week)
- Amazon FBA rates (per cubic foot per month)
- Invoice amounts and calculations

## 🧪 Testing

## 👨‍💻 Development Guidelines

### Branching Strategy

We follow a module-based branching strategy:

#### Branch Naming
- `ops/{feature}` - Operations module
- `fin/{feature}` - Finance module  
- `cfg/{feature}` - Configuration module
- `rpt/{feature}` - Reports module
- `int/{feature}` - Integrations module
- `adm/{feature}` - Admin module
- `fix/{bug}` - Bug fixes
- `docs/{update}` - Documentation

#### Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes within module boundaries
3. Create pull request for review
4. PR Master reviews and merges

#### Module Boundaries
Each module has specific directories it can modify:
- Operations: `/operations`, `/api/inventory`, `/api/transactions`
- Finance: `/finance`, `/api/invoices`, `/api/reconciliation`
- Config: `/config`, `/api/skus`, `/api/warehouses`, `/api/rates`
- Reports: `/reports`, `/api/reports` (read-only to other modules)
- Integrations: `/integrations`, `/api/amazon`
- Admin: `/admin`, `/api/users`, `/api/admin`

See `docs/BRANCHING_STRATEGY.md` for complete details.

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
```
feat(ops): Add bulk receive functionality
fix(fin): Correct invoice calculation
docs(cfg): Update rate configuration guide
```

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must have tests
- Tests must pass before PR approval
- Run tests with pattern matching:
  ```bash
  npm test -- --testPathPattern="operations"
  npm test -- --testPathPattern="finance"
  npm test -- --testPathPattern="config"
  ```
