# Security and Financial Integrity Fixes Summary

## Completed Fixes

### 1. Authorization Bypass (CRITICAL) ✅
**Issue**: Any authenticated user could access any warehouse's invoices
**Fix**: 
- Created `auth-utils.ts` with centralized authorization functions
- Added `hasWarehouseAccess()`, `getWarehouseFilter()`, and `canAccessInvoice()` utilities
- Updated all invoice endpoints to check warehouse access:
  - GET /api/invoices - Filters by user's warehouse access
  - GET/PUT/DELETE /api/invoices/[id] - Validates invoice warehouse access
  - POST /api/invoices/[id]/accept - Checks warehouse access
  - POST /api/invoices/[id]/dispute - Checks warehouse access
  - POST /api/invoices/upload - Validates warehouse access

### 2. Financial Calculation Precision (CRITICAL) ✅
**Issue**: JavaScript floating-point arithmetic causing rounding errors
**Fix**:
- Installed `decimal.js` library
- Created `financial-utils.ts` with Money class for precise calculations
- Implemented helper functions:
  - `parseMoney()` - Safe parsing from strings/numbers
  - `calculateLineItemTotal()` - Precise line item calculations
  - `calculateReconciliationDifference()` - Accurate reconciliation with threshold
- Updated endpoints to use Money class:
  - Invoice detail calculations
  - Reconciliation run calculations
  - Invoice upload parsing
  - Dispute amount calculations

### 3. Transaction Boundaries (HIGH) ✅
**Issue**: Invoice creation and reconciliation not atomic, could leave orphaned records
**Fix**:
- Wrapped invoice upload in Prisma transaction
- Created `startReconciliationInTransaction()` to run within same transaction
- Ensures invoice and reconciliation are created atomically

### 4. Race Condition in Invoice Creation (HIGH) ✅
**Issue**: Concurrent requests could create duplicate invoice numbers
**Fix**:
- Removed pre-check for existing invoice number
- Rely on database unique constraint for atomicity
- Added proper error handling for unique constraint violations (P2002)

## Remaining Tasks

### 5. Idempotency Keys (MEDIUM)
- Add idempotency token support to prevent duplicate operations from retries
- Store tokens in Redis or database with expiration

### 6. Optimistic Locking (MEDIUM)
- Add version field to invoices
- Check version on updates to prevent lost updates
- Return conflict error if version mismatch

### 7. 3PL Billing Features (MEDIUM)
- Support for tiered pricing
- Minimum charge calculations
- Fuel surcharge percentages
- Credit memo/adjustment invoices
- Partial payment tracking

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Security Tests**:
   - Verify staff can only access their warehouse's invoices
   - Test admin access to all warehouses
   - Ensure 403 errors for unauthorized access

2. **Financial Accuracy Tests**:
   - Test calculations with many decimal places
   - Verify no rounding errors in large datasets
   - Test edge cases like $0.005 amounts

3. **Concurrency Tests**:
   - Simulate concurrent invoice creation with same number
   - Test concurrent updates to same invoice
   - Verify transaction rollback on errors

4. **Integration Tests**:
   - Full invoice upload → reconciliation flow
   - Dispute workflow with calculations
   - Export functionality with new decimal precision
