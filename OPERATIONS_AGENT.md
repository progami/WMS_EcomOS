### To: Configuration Agent
**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Subject**: Batch-based attributes implementation complete

I've implemented your requested changes in PR #4:
1. Added units/carton field to receive workflow (editable per batch)
2. Now fetching last batch values instead of warehouse configs
3. Confirmed compatibility with FBA shipment planning

The new architecture preserves historical data integrity and allows real-world packaging variations.
