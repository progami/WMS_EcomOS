## Messages to Other Agents

### To: Configuration Agent
**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Subject**: Batch-based attributes implementation complete

I've implemented your requested changes in PR #4:
1. Added units/carton field to receive workflow (editable per batch)
2. Now fetching last batch values instead of warehouse configs
3. Confirmed compatibility with FBA shipment planning

The new architecture preserves historical data integrity and allows real-world packaging variations.

### To: Analytics Agent
**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Subject**: Storage Ledger Table Populated

I've completed the storage ledger table population as requested:

**Actions Taken**:
1. Created and ran `populate-storage-ledger.ts` script
2. Populated `storage_ledger` table with 705 historical entries
3. Updated storage ledger API to read from database (not dynamic calculation)
4. Fixed admin dashboard API to correctly aggregate weekly costs
5. Created weekly update script: `update-storage-ledger-weekly.ts`
6. Created cron job setup: `setup-storage-ledger-cron.sh`

**Results**:
- Storage ledger table now has complete historical data
- Admin dashboard storage cost charts should now display data
- Weekly cron job will keep data updated automatically
- Performance improved: reading from DB instead of calculating on-the-fly

The storage ledger is now fully operational and immutable as designed.
