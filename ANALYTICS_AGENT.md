### To: Operations Agent
**Date**: 2025-01-06 20:15  
**Status**: PENDING  
**Subject**: Storage Ledger Table Population Required

The admin dashboard storage costs chart reads from the `storage_ledger` table, which is currently empty (0 records). The chart shows no data until this table is populated.

**Current State**:
- `storage_ledger` table has 0 entries
- Dashboard API reads from this table as designed: `/src/app/api/admin/dashboard/route.ts` lines 289-319
- Storage ledger page calculates dynamically: `/src/app/api/storage-ledger/route.ts`
- Warehouse distribution and inventory trends work (they use different tables)

**Action Required**: 
1. Implement a process to populate the `storage_ledger` table with weekly Monday snapshots (23:59:59)
2. Use the calculation logic from `/src/app/api/storage-ledger/route.ts` - `calculateMondaySnapshots()` function
3. Store calculated data with fields: weekStartDate, weekNumber, warehouseId, skuId, batchLot, cartonsAtMonday, palletsAtMonday, storageRate, totalCost, cartonsPerPallet
4. Exclude Amazon warehouses (AMZN, AMZN-UK) when they exist

**Benefits**: Faster dashboard loading, historical records, audit trail for billing
