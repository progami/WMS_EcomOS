# Documentation

Comprehensive documentation for the Warehouse Management System.

## System Overview

This warehouse management system replaces a complex Excel-based solution with a modern web application while maintaining the same proven business logic. The system tracks inventory movements as transactions, calculates storage costs based on weekly Monday stock-takes, and manages billing reconciliation across multiple 3PL warehouses.

### Core Principles
1. **Transaction-Based Ledger**: Every inventory movement is an immutable transaction
2. **Real-time Balances**: Current inventory calculated from transaction history
3. **Weekly Billing Cycles**: Monday stock-takes align with 3PL industry standards
4. **Complete Audit Trail**: All changes tracked, never deleted
5. **Unified Interface**: Single inventory page with tabs for ledger and balances
6. **Simplified Roles**: Two-role system (Admin and Staff) for clearer permissions
