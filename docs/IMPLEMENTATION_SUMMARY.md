# WMS Implementation Summary

## Recent Major Changes

### 1. Fault-Tolerant SKU Management
**Problem**: Changing `unitsPerCarton` in SKU master data would retroactively change all historical inventory calculations.

**Solution**: 
- Added `unitsPerCarton` field to inventory transactions
- Capture SKU value at transaction time
- Historical data now immutable
- Unit calculations use transaction values, not current SKU values

**Impact**:
- No accidental historical data changes
- Accurate reporting for all time periods
- Clear audit trail of what values were used

### 2. Enhanced SKU View with Global Aggregation
**Problem**: Users had to mentally add up same SKU across multiple warehouses.

**Solution**:
- "By SKU" view shows global totals
- Expandable rows reveal warehouse breakdown
- Progressive disclosure for detailed information

**Benefits**:
- Strategic planning with company-wide view
- Quick identification of stock distribution
- Cleaner, more intuitive interface

### 3. Intelligent Batch Attributes Integration
**Problem**: Separate batch attributes page was disconnected from inventory view.

**Solution**:
- Integrated batch data into inventory balance table
- Added expandable rows for batch details
- Removed redundant batch attributes page
- Enhanced API to fetch creator information

**Result**:
- Single source of truth for inventory data
- Better context with all information in one place
- Reduced navigation complexity

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
1. **Contextual Tracking Numbers**: Single field that means different things in different contexts
2. **Editable Daily Velocity**: Direct editing in FBA planning with real-time recalculation
3. **Low Stock Highlighting**: Visual indicators for items needing restock
4. **Compact View Toggle**: SKU/Batch toggle moved inline, active state in green
5. **Proper Menu Organization**: Finance menu reordered to match workflow

## Key Design Principles Applied

1. **Fault Tolerance**: System protects users from mistakes
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show summary, expand for details
3. **Single Source of Truth**: One place for each type of data
4. **Contextual Information**: Right data at the right time
5. **Visual Feedback**: Colors and highlights guide attention

## Database Integrity

- Transactions capture point-in-time data
- Balances calculated from transaction history
- Master data changes only affect future
- Clear separation of concerns

## Next Considerations

1. **SKU Versioning**: Full version history (currently just snapshot)
2. **Effective Dating**: Schedule future SKU changes
3. **Change Notifications**: Alert users when master data changes
4. **Bulk Operations**: Edit multiple SKUs at once

## Lessons Learned

1. **Immutability Matters**: Historical data should never change unexpectedly
2. **Context Over Configuration**: One field can serve multiple purposes
3. **Integration Over Separation**: Related data belongs together
4. **User Protection**: Design systems that prevent mistakes
5. **Clarity Over Cleverness**: Make implications obvious to users
