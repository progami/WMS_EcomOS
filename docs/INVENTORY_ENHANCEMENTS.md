# Inventory Balance Enhancements

## Overview

The inventory balance view has been enhanced to intelligently combine batch attributes with inventory balances, eliminating the need for a separate batch attributes page.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Integrated Batch Attributes
- **Pallet Configuration**: Storage and shipping cartons per pallet are now displayed inline in the inventory balance table
- **Visual Indicators**: Batches with custom pallet configurations show a purple badge
- **Batch Metadata**: Units per carton is shown as a blue badge for easy reference

### 2. Enhanced Column Display
The inventory balance table now includes:
- **Storage Config**: Shows storage cartons per pallet with "storage" label
- **Shipping Config**: Shows shipping cartons per pallet with "shipping" label  
- **Units/Carton**: Displayed as a badge for quick reference
- **Received By**: Shows who initially received the batch

### 3. Expandable Rows
Click on any inventory balance row to expand and see:
- **Batch Created**: Date when the batch was first received
- **Received By**: Person who received the goods
- **Pallet Configuration**: Full details of storage and shipping configurations
- **Total Value**: Total units and units per carton breakdown

### 4. Smart Summary
The summary cards now show:
- Total pallets with a subtitle showing how many have batch-specific configurations
- Visual chevron indicators (→/↓) to show expandable rows

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Single View**: No need to navigate between inventory balances and batch attributes
2. **Contextual Information**: All batch-specific data is shown where it's most relevant
3. **Performance**: Data is fetched efficiently with enhanced API queries
4. **Visual Clarity**: Purple badges indicate batches with custom configurations

## Technical Implementation

- Enhanced the `/api/inventory/balances` endpoint to fetch receive transaction data
- Added expandable row functionality with smooth transitions
- Integrated batch attribute columns into the standard column ordering system
- Removed the separate batch attributes page from navigation

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Navigation**: Users don't need to switch between pages
2. **Better Context**: Batch attributes are shown alongside current stock levels
3. **Improved Efficiency**: All relevant information in one place
4. **Cleaner UI**: Eliminated redundant page and navigation item
