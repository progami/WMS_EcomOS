# Warehouse Management System - Complete Overview

## üéØ System Purpose

This warehouse management system replaces complex Excel spreadsheets with a modern web application while maintaining the same business logic. It tracks inventory movements, calculates storage costs, and manages billing across multiple 3PL (third-party logistics) warehouses.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with session-based auth
- **Deployment**: Optimized for Vercel/similar platforms

### Core Design Principles
1. **Transaction-Based Ledger**: All inventory is tracked through immutable transactions
2. **Point-in-Time Calculations**: Can reconstruct inventory state at any historical date
3. **Excel Compatibility**: Maintains exact business logic from original Excel system
4. **Real-time Updates**: Instant balance calculations from transaction history

## üë• User Roles (Simplified 2-Role System)

### Admin Role
- Full system access and configuration
- User management
- System settings
- Import/export data
- Run calculations
- All operational features

### Staff Role  
- Operational access
- Inventory management
- Invoice processing
- Reports and analytics
- Rate viewing
- Settings access

## üìä Data Model

### Core Entities

#### Inventory Transactions
- Every movement is a transaction (RECEIVE, SHIP, ADJUST_IN, ADJUST_OUT)
- Immutable audit trail
- Links to warehouse, SKU, and batch/lot

#### Inventory Balances
- Calculated from transaction history
- Current state by Warehouse + SKU + Batch/Lot
- Never manually edited

#### Storage Ledger
- Weekly snapshots taken every Monday at 23:59:59
- Calculates pallets used for billing
- Billing periods: 16th to 15th of month

#### Cost Rates
- Time-based rate tables
- Categories: Container, Carton, Pallet, Storage, Unit, Shipment
- Effective date ranges

## üîÑ Key Workflows

### 1. Receiving Inventory
1. Navigate to Inventory Ledger
2. Click "Receive Goods" button
3. Enter receipt details (date, SKU, batch, quantity)
4. System creates RECEIVE transaction
5. Balances update automatically

### 2. Shipping Inventory
1. Navigate to Inventory Ledger  
2. Click "Ship Goods" button
3. Select items to ship (validates available quantity)
4. System creates SHIP transaction
5. Balances update automatically

### 3. Storage Billing Calculation
1. Admin runs "Storage Ledger" calculation
2. System takes Monday snapshots of inventory
3. Calculates pallets based on SKU configuration
4. Applies weekly storage rates
5. Generates billing period charges (16th-15th)

### 4. Invoice Reconciliation
1. Upload warehouse invoices (PDF/Excel)
2. System extracts line items
3. Compares against calculated costs
4. Identifies variances
5. Allows resolution and notes

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Key Business Rules
1. No negative inventory allowed
2. Transactions cannot be edited/deleted (only adjustments)
3. Monday 23:59:59 snapshots for billing
4. Billing period: 16th to 15th
5. All dates in Central Time (CT)
6. Currency in GBP (¬£)

## üö® Important Notes

### Data Integrity
- Never modify inventory_balances directly
- All changes through transactions only
- Preserve zero-balance records
- Maintain complete audit trail

### Performance Considerations
- Balance calculations are real-time
- Large transaction sets may need pagination
- Storage ledger calculation is resource-intensive
- Consider background jobs for large calculations

### Migration from Excel
- Import script handles historical data
- Preserves all transaction history
- Maintains exact Excel calculations
- Zero data loss guaranteed

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Automated email notifications
- API for external integrations  
- Mobile app for warehouse staff
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Predictive inventory planning

### Technical Debt
- Add comprehensive error logging
- Implement job queue for calculations
- Add data archival strategy
- Enhance test coverage

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Problems**
   - Check user is active
   - Verify correct role assigned
   - Clear browser cookies

2. **Missing Data**
   - Run inventory balance calculation
