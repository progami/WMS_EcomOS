## üìù Final Recommendations

1. **Focus on Finance Module:** This is the critical path - without invoicing and reconciliation, the system isn't usable

2. **Start Analytics Immediately:** They're significantly behind and need to catch up

3. **Daily Sync Meetings:** Given the delays, implement daily check-ins

4. **Integration Testing:** As soon as Finance completes core features, begin integration testing

5. **Performance Testing:** Plan for this before production deployment

6. **Documentation Sprint:** Allocate time for updating user documentation

---

## üöÄ Next Steps for PR Master

1. Monitor Finance agent progress closely
2. Ensure Analytics agent starts work immediately
3. Coordinate integration testing once Finance is ready
4. Plan for performance testing phase
5. Schedule documentation updates
6. Prepare production deployment checklist
